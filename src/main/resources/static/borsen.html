    <p><em>Børsen</em>, the historic stock exchange in Copenhagen, Denmark, is one of the city’s most iconic buildings, renowned
        for its distinctive Renaissance architecture. Built in the early 17th century under the reign of King Christian
        IV, the structure is famous for its unique spire, known as the "Dragon Spire," which consists of the intertwined
        tails of four dragons and symbolizes strength and unity.

        Originally designed as a hub for trade and commerce, Børsen played a pivotal role in Denmark’s economic history,
        facilitating trade with merchants from across Europe. Though no longer the active stock exchange, the building
        remains a prominent symbol of Danish financial and commercial heritage.

        Today, Børsen houses the Danish Chamber of Commerce and is often used for events, conferences, and official
        functions. Its blend of history and architectural grandeur attracts visitors from around the world. The
        building’s central location near Christiansborg Palace and other notable landmarks adds to its significance in
        Copenhagen’s historic district.</p>
